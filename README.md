# Gene Set Variation Analysis (GSVA)

This analysis conducts a Gene Set Variation Analysis using the 'GSVA' package (HÃ¤nzelmann et al., 2013). 

GSVA is derivative of a traditional differential expression technique, but instead of a traditional _gene expression_ (outcome) - preditor + model design with you have instead _gene set variation_ (outcome). This technique uses a random walk approach. 

There are **four** analyses 
 1) Gene Set Variation Analyses
 2) Volcano Plotting of GSVA Effect Sizes 
 3) Plotting GSVA Enrichment Scores Stratified by Variables
 4) CTRA Effect Sizes Across Terms

There are **two** files 
1) Driver Script (.rmd with functions)
2) Script (.rmd calling the functions)
