# Gene Set Variation Analysis (GSVA)

This analysis conducts a Gene Set Variation Analysis using the 'GSVA' package (HÃ¤nzelmann et al., 2013). This is a differential expression technique used to swap out the traditional _gene expression_ (outcome) - preditor + model with instead _gene set variation_ (outcome) - preditor + model

There are **four** analyses 
 1) Gene Set Variation Analyses
 2) Volcano Plotting
 3) Enrcihment scores from the GSVA 
 4) CTRA effect sizes across terms

There are **two** files 
1) Driver (.rmd with functions)
2) Script (.rmd calling the functions)
